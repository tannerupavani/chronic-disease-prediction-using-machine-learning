# chronic-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The system leverages patient data, including demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors, to predict the likelihood of chronic disease onset.
